# Simple Toy Dispatcher

This is a simple First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) dispatcher implemented in C. It demonstrates basic process scheduling by running jobs sequentially based on their arrival times.
Maybe in the future I will make some upgrades to this.

## Installation

This isn't the most interesting project, but if for some reason you would like
to try running it yourself, simply download the project and run the following.

```bash
# compile
make
make build_dummy_prog

# run
./disp <path to job schedule file>
```

## Example

![demo]("disp_demo.mp4")
